    "# Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "Measuring poverty in developing countries is a complex undertaking. Money-metric poverty measurements require the calculation of national or international poverty lines, and the collection and analysis of detailed data on households’ income or consumption. Due to their complexity and cost, such surveys are conducted infrequently in many low-income countries, and typically on relatively small samples of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we conduct an empirical comparative assessment of machine learning classification algorithms applied to poverty prediction. The primary objective of the project is to answer the following questions:\n",
    "* How well would machine algorithms perform when given the task to identify the poor in a given population?\n",
    "* Where, when and how could or should we apply them for that specific purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "A secondary objective is to make machine learning techniques more accessible to researchers, data scientists, and statisticians in developing countries by generating training materials and building capacity. Machine learning tools and methods can be implemented at a low cost to many different purposes and data types. By making their use more technically accessible, the project will contribute to improving the data producers and decision makers' toolkit in developing countries."

    "## Binary Classification <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"binary-classification\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use the survey data to build a model that predicts if a household is poor or non-poor. This problem is considered a [binary classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification) problem. The machine learning models we will introduce in this project all attempt to use the survey data to \"learn\" the rules that determine the answer to the question \"Is this household under the poverty level?\". \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's say we have only two questions on a survey, with answers that range from 1 to 10. We give the survey to 100 households, half of which are poor and the other half non-poor. In the figure below, we plot the survey responses and mark poor households with a blue cross and non-poor households with a red circle. If we use a straight line as the decision boundary, we can do a pretty good job of separating the markers, with poor households above the line and non-poor below the line. The goal of a binary classification algorithm would be to find the formula for this line so we can apply it to new households that we don't already know are poor or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"binary classification diagram\" src=\"img/binary-classification.png\" width=\"75%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the decision boundary in the figure is a pretty good fit, but there are a few exceptions of red circles above the line and blue crosses below the line. If we were to use this decision boundary as our classifier, these points would be incorrectly classified. We may not be able to find a function that perfectly separates the points, but we want to train our binary classifier to find the line that give us the lowest amount of error. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the actual datasets we will be working with in this project, there are hundreds of questions, and the relationships between them are more complex. The binary classification algorithms we will explore each have unique ways of learning these relationships. At the end of this project, we will be able to compare how each one performs on this type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the data for binary classification, we need to ensure it is in a format suitable for the machine learning tools we plan to use. This means transforming each survey response into a set of independent variables, or a [feature vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_vector), that corresponds to the dependent variable of poverty."

    "## Binary Classification Algorithms\n",
    "In this project, we will apply and compare 10 different binary classification algorithms to poverty datasets from Malawi and Indonesia. There will be two Jupyter Notebooks associated with each algorithm: In the first, we introduce the classifier and apply it to the Malawi dataset, beginning with a simple subset of features to highlight basic considerations and parameters of the model. We then apply it to the full set of features, including sample weights when possible, and explore different methods for feature selection and parameter tuning to increase performance. In the second notebook, we apply the classifier to the Indonesia dataset. Here we explore considerations for how to deal with unbalanced data and examine how the classifer performns on a somewhat different set of features in the context of another country. In each notebook we will also use the results of the classifier to estimate the country's poverty level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms we will explore in this project include:\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression\n",
    "1. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)\n",
    "1. K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "1. Naive Bayes\n",

This notebook should be run first from the project directory to produce the processed files we will use in following notebooks.\n",

    "### Raw data overview\n",
    "The data for this project includes data and metadata from surveys in two countries -- Indonesia and Malawi. For each country, you will find:\n",
    "* The survey questionnaire(s)\n",
    "* Two Stata (version 14) data files: household and individual. These data contain a subset of the full survey dataset\n",
    "* An Excel file, providing a list of variables in the data files\n",
    "* Two text files (output of the “codebook” Stata command, providing a list of variables with some metadata.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Stata file contents\n",
    "The Stata data files contain:\n",
    "* The label variable (the binary variable to be predicted), named “poor”. This is just a poor/non-poor dummy variable. Note: poverty is calculated at the household level; either all or none of one same household member is/are poor.\n",
    "* The sample weights (the objective is to “predict” poverty taking into account these sample weights. Variable `wta_hh` contains the household weight; variable `wta_pop` contains the population weight (household weight * household size). These are probability weights (the sum of `wta_pop` gives us the extrapolated population of the country).\n",
    "* The file that will be used as training/test set is the `household.dta` file.\n",
    "* The `individual.dta` file contains variables on each household member. The file is provided to allow us to create additional variables to be added to the `household.dta` file. The variable `hhsize` (household size) is one such derived variable, already calculated. We will probably use this to generate new variables to possibly improve the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering Consumable Feaures\n",
    "The `household.dta` file contains a series of variables whose name starts with `cons_`. These are variables derived from the expenditure module of the survey. It indicates whether a household consumed/purchased a specific item or not. Any reported value > 0 for an item was transformed into code 1; 0 otherwise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT*: Since one objective of this project is to design light survey questionnaires that would allow accurate poverty prediction, we want to be selective in the list of variables we use in the final model. What we would like to do is optimize a model using the variables we find useful (including new derived variables), under the constraint that no more than 50 of the `cons_` variables will be used. Some quick analysis of these `cons_` variables should make it possible to make a selection prior to tuning the models."

    "1. There appears to be some conflict in how pandas and Stata deal with categoricals, so we have to load the data in without converting categoricals and load the labels separately using pandas StataReader. The issue was with several entries in the `ind_educ09` column of the Malawi individual data -- there are duplicate labels for Primary and Secondary school choices: \"CHURCH/MISSION SCHOOL\" and \"ISLAMIC SCHOOL\", which raises an error when pandas attempts to convert categoricals. We manually fix this in the function below using the `update_education` parameter.\n",

    "1. There are a small number of entries in the Malawi household data that do not match any of the labels.

    "## Dummy variables <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"dummy-variables\"></a>\n",
    "Another consideration is the creation of [dummy variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics%29). Some classification algorithms are able to handle categorical variables easily, but others require the inputs to be numeric. When we have categorical variables, the preffered method is to create dummy variables. This takes the categorical feature and creates a new binary column for each value. We can also include a dummy to deal with missing values. We don't necessarily want a dummy for every column, though. If we have n columns from n categories, every column is actually a linear combination of the other columns, creating a [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) problem known as the [dummy variable trap](http://www.algosome.com/articles/dummy-variable-trap-regression.html). To deal with this issue, we drop the first dummy variable for each categorical variable. Pandas has a nice function called [`get_dummies()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html) that makes this process simple. \n",
